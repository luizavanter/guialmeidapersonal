In over 20 years helping people lose weight, I've identified clear patterns of mistakes that sabotage results. The good news? They're all avoidable once you know what to look for.

## Mistake #1: Only Doing Cardio

**The problem:** Many people think losing weight = running or spending hours on the treadmill.

**Why it doesn't work:**
- Excessive cardio can cause muscle loss
- Metabolism slows down with loss of lean mass
- The body adapts and burns fewer calories
- Results plateau within weeks

**Solution:** Combine weight training (to maintain/build muscle) with moderate cardio. Muscles accelerate your metabolism 24/7, not just during the workout.

## Mistake #2: Overly Restrictive Dieting

**The problem:** Cutting calories drastically seems logical, but it's a trap.

**What happens:**
- Metabolism slows down to compensate
- Hunger and fatigue increase exponentially
- Adherence drops (no one can sustain it long-term)
- Rebound effect is practically guaranteed

**Solution:** Moderate caloric deficit (300-500 calories). You lose weight more slowly but sustainably and without suffering.

## Mistake #3: Ignoring Protein

**The problem:** Focusing only on cutting carbs and fats while neglecting protein.

**Why this kills your results:**
- Protein preserves muscle mass during a deficit
- Increases satiety (you feel less hungry)
- Has a higher thermic effect (burns more energy to digest)
- Essential for workout recovery

**Solution:** Consume 1.8-2.2g of protein per kg of body weight. Distribute it across 4-5 meals throughout the day.

## Mistake #4: Not Monitoring Progress

**The problem:** Thinking the scale is the only indicator of success.

**Why it's misleading:**
- Weight fluctuates daily (water, digestion, hormones)
- You can gain muscle and lose fat (same weight, different body)
- The scale doesn't differentiate fat from muscle

**Solution:** Use multiple indicators:
- ✅ Measurements (waist, hips, arms, thighs)
- ✅ Weekly photos (visual comparison is powerful)
- ✅ How your clothes fit
- ✅ Monthly bioimpedance testing
- ✅ Energy levels and mood

## Mistake #5: Inconsistency

**The problem:** Being perfect for 3 days, giving up for 4. Starting over. Repeating.

**Why it kills results:**
- Your body needs consistent stimulus
- Adaptations take time (4-6 weeks minimum)
- The guilt-and-frustration cycle destroys your mindset
- Each "restart" is harder than the last

**Solution:** Focus on adherence, not perfection:
- 80% discipline is enough
- Allow planned free meals
- Don't give up at the first slip
- Think in months and years, not days

## Bonus: The Mistake Few Talk About

### Not Having a Structured Plan

Training randomly, eating "more or less well," sleeping when you can. That's not a strategy — that's hope.

**Solution:** Have a program:
- Periodized training designed by a professional
- Realistic meal plan
- Consistent sleep routine
- Weekly check-ins

## Real Case: Mariana

She came to me doing 2 hours of cardio per day, eating 1,200 calories, frustrated because she hadn't lost weight in 2 months.

**Changes:**
- Reduced cardio to 3x 30 minutes per week
- Added weight training 4x per week
- Increased calories to 1,800 (with a focus on protein)
- Started sleeping 7-8 hours per night

**Result:** Lost 18kg in 6 months, gained muscle mass, increased metabolism.

## Checklist: Are You Making These Mistakes?

- [ ] Are you only doing cardio or doing excessive cardio?
- [ ] Have you cut calories drastically (below 1,500/day)?
- [ ] Are you eating less than 1.5g of protein per kg of body weight?
- [ ] Do you only track your weight on the scale?
- [ ] Do you train hard 3-4 days then disappear for a week?

If you checked 2 or more, your results are being compromised.

## Conclusion

Losing weight isn't complicated, but it needs to be done right. Avoid these 5 mistakes and you'll find that losing weight can be easier (and more sustainable) than you think.
